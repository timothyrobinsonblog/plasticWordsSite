        Welcome. Our job at Plastic Words is to transform your thoughts into a concise and creative story. We achieve this by playing with words. By taking messages apart and reassembling them. By getting creative. The above paragraph on the left contains 164 words, but 15 edits are possible. That's one change every 10.9 words. Hover over the pink and blue squares to discover this magical word-crafting. Let's make every word count. Otherwise, just enter our site using the menu on the right. Have fun.

        <span class="box2-reason">The Lorem Ipsum is a section from Cicero's speeches that is used to signify where text will be; the original "your words here". </span>
        <span class="box3-reason">Repetition of the same sentiment within a sentence. Reduces readability and takes up space.</span>
        <span class="box4-reason">Use of specific and impressive data can create authority in an otherwise unbelievable statement.</span>
        <span class="box5-reason">Escher sentences sound as though they mean something but are nonsense when you attempt to understand them.</span>
        <span class="box6-reason">Using unnecessarily long words where simpler ones will do reduces readability and clutters work.</span>
        <span class="box7-reason">Use of common cliche can make an audience assume they already know what you're trying to say and stop reading.</span>
        <span class="box8-reason">Redundant descriptors; these all say the same thing.</span>
        <span class="box9-reason">Tautology, saying the same thing twice over in different words.</span>
        <span class="box10-reason">Misspelling.</span>
        <span class="box11-reason">Run on sentence with no breaks. This could easily be two sentences to improve readability.</span>
        <span class="box12-reason">Repetition of phrasing creates rhythm and draws the reader in.</span>
        <span class="box13-reason">Passive voice, puts distance between ownership of the action, feels detached.</span>
        <span class="box14-reason">Filler words can removed without impacting the sentence.</span>
        <span class="box15-reason">'Very' is a qualifier that can be replaced with better use of precise language.</span>
        <span class="box16-reason">Inappropriate word use; close to the right words but not correct.</span>
