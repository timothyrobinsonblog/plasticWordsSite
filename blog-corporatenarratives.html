        <p>Like a reliable watering hole, your company story should be the source of your brand and service messaging. Being able to confidently return to it makes such messaging a smooth task and ensures consistency. Keep it simple. Don’t pollute or dilute it.</p>

        <p>Sounds easy, right? But what if you are unsure how clear your company story is? What if your messaging feels too shallow? Or, possibly worse, so deep that it turns people away? These are questions to get to the bottom of. It takes a little bit of work, but it’s worth it.</p>

        <p>People address this challenge in different ways. Some people refine an elevator pitch. They try to explain their business or product in thirty seconds, two sentences, or even a couple of words. Others develop a logo and brand identity that holds everything together. Here the idea is that if the image or slogan is appealing right away, then half the battle is already won.</p>

        <p>In all these cases, the goal is the same as any good story: to stand out in the moment and stick in the memory. Here, three questions give provide a starting place:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>What is it that you offer?</li>
          <li>Who are you offering it to?</li>
          <li>Why should they care?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>With these questions in mind, take a look at your website. Does it answer these questions? Sure, this might seem obvious to you - after all, you know your business better than anyone. But what about a first time visitor? A stranger who has chanced upon your website, or perhaps found their way to it while looking for something completely different? Does your messaging serve as a helpful guide? If you’re not there to explain it personally, like you would with an elevator pitch, would it still accomplish the sense-making you designed it for?</p>

        <p>We spend a lot of time helping our clients develop and apply their narratives. Whether it’s how the company identifies itself in the digital landscape, or how a specific product can improve the lives of their customers. We find the right words to craft a unique, approachable, and repeatable story that your company can use across its brand and product messaging.</p>

        <p>We do this through a series of development stages, involving comprehensive discussion and reviews to distil the right information and phrasing. This allows us to gain a well-rounded understanding of what will work best for you, so that your customers get the clear and memorable messaging they deserve.</p>

        <p>At Plastic Words, we do the word work. Let us help you develop a company story that will serve you for years to come.</p>
